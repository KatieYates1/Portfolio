    <h3>About Me:</h3>
    <p id="aboutMeBox"> I am a 2nd year Game Design and Development student at Rochester
        Institute of Technology. With a strong passion for the arts and helping out my friends, I have
        work on many games including genres like horror, narrative, and 2D minigames. I cant wait to continue learning
        and growing my skills in school and in the industry.

    <p id="FlowerShopText"><a href="">Flower Shop: Business is Blooming</a>, starting with a group of three in WICHacks 2025. It includes me, Bella Miller and Abby Rochelle. It's a game we started with not really any knowledge of making games since it was only our first year at RIT. Since then we have been working on making it a better game and hopefully apply to RIT’s Magic Maker program to get the game shipped! As the lead designer for the game, I have sketched and created many mockups of characters and environments. I also help design the game mechanics and how we are going to take the story. It's been a really fun experience and I can’t wait to continue to develop the game!
